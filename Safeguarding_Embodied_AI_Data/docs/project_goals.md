# Project Goals: Safeguarding Embodied AI Data

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop robust mechanisms for protecting data in embodied AI systems. This includes ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability throughout the AI system's lifecycle.

## Key Research Areas

1. **Data Encryption**: Implementing advanced encryption techniques to protect sensitive data.
2. **Fault Recovery**: Developing reliable recovery mechanisms to handle system failures.
3. **Security Testing**: Creating comprehensive testing frameworks to validate security measures.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring that security measures do not significantly impact system performance.

## Expected Outcomes

- Secure data handling mechanisms for embodied AI systems
- Resilient fault recovery systems
- Comprehensive security testing protocols
- Performance benchmarks and optimization strategies
